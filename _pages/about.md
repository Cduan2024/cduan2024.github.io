I am a visiting assistant professor (non-tenure track) at University of Massachusetts-Amherst working on geometric representation theory. My supervisors are Prof.[Alexei Oblomkov](https://people.math.umass.edu/~oblomkov/) and Prof.[Eric Sommers](https://people.math.umass.edu/~esommers/).

I graduated with PhD in mathematics from University of Maryland-College Park in Summer 2024. My advisors are Prof.[Xuhua He](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~xuhuahe/), HKU and Prof.[Thomas Haines](https://www.math.umd.edu/~tjh/). Before that I was an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University.

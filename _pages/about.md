I am a visiting assistant professor (non-tenure track) at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. My supervisors are [Alexei Oblomkov](https://people.math.umass.edu/~oblomkov/) and [Eric Sommers](https://people.math.umass.edu/~esommers/). Before this I was a graduate student at the University of Maryland-College Park.
